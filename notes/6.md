## **Tuples and Sets in Python**

### **1. Tuples in Python**

A tuple is a collection of items that is **ordered** and **immutable** (unchangeable). Tuples are similar to lists, but once a tuple is created, you cannot modify it. They are often used to group related data together.

#### **Syntax**:
```python
my_tuple = (element1, element2, element3, ...)
```

#### **Example**:
```python
my_tuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
numbers_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4)
```

#### **Creating a Tuple with One Element**:
To create a tuple with only one element, include a trailing comma:
```python
single_element_tuple = ("apple",)
```

---

### **2. Accessing Tuple Elements**

You can access elements in a tuple using **indexing**, just like with lists. Tuples also support negative indexing.

#### **Example**:
```python
fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print(fruits[0])  # Output: apple
print(fruits[-1])  # Output: cherry
```

#### **Slicing Tuples**:
You can also slice tuples to access a subset of the elements.
```python
print(fruits[1:3])  # Output: ('banana', 'cherry')

#### ** we modify the tuple inside list  but we can not able make modify tuple inside the tuple **
**we modify the tuple inside list**
numbers =(1,2,[3,4,[7,8]],5,6)
numbers[2][0] =12
print(numbers)
output is : (1, 2, [12, 4, [7, 8]], 5, 6) #instead of 3 we assign 12

**we can not able make modify tuple inside the tuple**
numbers =(1,2,(3,4,(7,8)),5,6)
numbers[2][0] =12
print(numbers)
output is : TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment

**## slicing of tupples we using here negetive indexing and posstive indexing we get same ans ##**
**negetive slice indexing**
numbers =(1,2,[3,4,[7,8]],5,6)
numbers1 = numbers[-3], numbers[-1] 
print(numbers1)

output is = ([3, 4, [7, 8]], 6)

**possitve indexing **
numbers =(1,2,[3,4,[7,8]],5,6)
numbers1 = numbers[2]
numbers2 = numbers[4]
print(numbers1, numbers2)

output is : [3, 4, [7, 8]] 6
```

### **3. Tuple Operations**

Although tuples are immutable, you can perform various operations with them.

#### **Tuple Concatenation**:
You can combine two or more tuples using the `+` operator.
```python
tuple1 = (1, 2, 3)
tuple2 = (4, 5, 6)
combined_tuple = tuple1 + tuple2
print(combined_tuple)  # Output: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
```

#### **Tuple Repetition**:
You can repeat a tuple multiple times using the `*` operator.
```python
repeated_tuple = (1, 2) * 3
print(repeated_tuple)  # Output: (1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2)
```

#### **Checking Membership**:
You can check if an item exists in a tuple using the `in` operator.
```python
print("apple" in fruits)  # Output: True
```

### **4. Tuple Methods**

Though tuples are immutable, Python provides some built-in methods for working with tuples.

- `count()`: Returns the number of times an element appears in the tuple.
  ```python
  my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 1, 1)
  print(my_tuple.count(1))  # Output: 3
  ```

- `index()`: Returns the index of the first occurrence of an element.
  ```python
  my_tuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
  print(my_tuple.index("banana"))  # Output: 1
  ```

---

### **5. Advantages of Using Tuples**

- **Immutable**: This property ensures that tuple data cannot be modified after creation, making them useful for fixed data.
- **Faster than Lists**: Due to immutability, tuples are generally faster than lists.
- **Can Be Used as Keys in Dictionaries**: Since tuples are hashable, they can be used as keys in dictionaries, unlike lists.

### **6. Sets in Python**

A set is a collection of **unique** items that is **unordered** and **unindexed**. Sets do not allow duplicate values. Sets are useful for performing operations like union, intersection, and difference.

#### **Syntax**:
```python
my_set = {element1, element2, element3, ...}
```

#### **Example**:
```python
fruits_set = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
numbers_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
```

#### **Empty Set**:
To create an empty set, use the `set()` function (not `{}`, which creates an empty dictionary).
```python
empty_set = set()
```

---

### **7. Set Operations**

Sets support mathematical operations like union, intersection, and difference.

#### **Union**:
The union of two sets combines all elements from both sets, removing duplicates.
```python
set1 = {1, 2, 3}
set2 = {3, 4, 5}
union_set = set1 | set2  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
```

#### **Intersection**:
The intersection of two sets returns elements that are common to both sets.
```python
intersection_set = set1 & set2  # Output: {3}
```

#### **Difference**:
The difference between two sets returns elements that are in the first set but not in the second.
```python
difference_set = set1 - set2  # Output: {1, 2}
```

#### **Symmetric Difference**:
The symmetric difference returns elements that are in either of the sets but not in both.
```python
sym_diff_set = set1 ^ set2  # Output: {1, 2, 4, 5}
```
set1 = {"banana", "apple", "mango", "orange"}
set2 = {"apple","grapes", "patota"}

union_set = set1 | set2 ### union set
print(union_set)

union_set = set1 & set2 ### intersection set
print(union_set)

union_set = set1 - set2 ### difference set
print(union_set)

union_set = set1 ^ set2 ### symmetric difference set
print(union_set)

---

### **8. Set Methods**

Sets come with several useful methods for performing common tasks.

- `add()`: Adds an element to the set.
  ```python
  fruits_set.add("orange")
  print(fruits_set)  # Output: {'apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'orange'}
  ```

- `remove()`: Removes a specified element from the set. Raises an error if the element does not exist.
  ```python
  fruits_set.remove("banana")
  print(fruits_set)  # Output: {'apple', 'cherry'}
  ```

- `discard()`: Removes a specified element without raising an error if it does not exist.
  ```python
  fruits_set.discard("banana")  # No error if "banana" is not in the set
  ```

- `pop()`: Removes a random element from the set.
  ```python
  fruits_set.pop()
  ```

- `clear()`: Removes all elements from the set.
  ```python
  fruits_set.clear()
  ```

### **Homework**

1. **Tuple Operations**:
   - Create a tuple with 5 elements.
   - Try to modify one of the elements. What happens?
   - Perform slicing on the tuple to extract the second and third elements.
   - Concatenate the tuple with another tuple.

2. **Set Operations**:
   - Create two sets: one with your favorite fruits and another with your friend’s favorite fruits.
   - Find the union, intersection, and difference between the two sets.
   - Add a new fruit to your set.
   - Remove a fruit from your set using both `remove()` and `discard()`. What happens when the fruit doesn’t exist?

3. **Tuple and Set Comparison**:
   - Create a list of elements and convert it into both a tuple and a set.
  
            l = ["banana", "apple", "mango"]
            l1 = tuple(l)
            l2 = set(l)
            print(l1)
            print(l2)

   - Print both the tuple and the set.

      output is :

     ('banana', 'apple', 'mango')

     {'banana', 'mango', 'apple'}

    - Try to add new elements to the tuple and set. What differences do you observe?

     **##tuple##**
     Tuples are immutable, so you cannot directly add or remove elements from a tuple after it is created. Any attempt to do so will result in an error.
     eg : my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
          my_tuple.append(4)

     output is : AttributeError: 'tuple' object has no attribute 'append'

     If you need to "add" an element to a tuple, you can create a new tuple by concatenating the original one with another tuple:

            my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
            my_tuple = my_tuple + (4,)  # Create a new tuple
            print(my_tuple)

          output is : (1, 2, 3, 4)

     **##set##**
     Sets are mutable, so you can directly add new elements using the add() method or combine sets using the update() or union() methods.

            my_set = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
            my_set.add("orange")  # Add a single element
            print(my_set)

     output is : {'banana', 'apple', 'cherry', 'orange'}

     You can also add multiple elements at once:

            my_set.update(["mango", "grape"])  # Add multiple elements
            print(my_set)

     output is : {'banana', 'apple', 'cherry', 'orange', 'mango', 'grape'}
